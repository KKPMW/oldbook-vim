In addition you can inspect this theme at **[VIVIFY](http://bytefluent.com/vivify/index.php?remote=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KKPMW/oldbook-vim/master/colors/oldbook.vim)**

### Installation ###

Install manually or with your favorite plug-in manager and then load the theme.

With `vim-plug`:

```VimL
Plug 'KKPMW/oldbook-vim'
colorscheme oldbook
```

The colorscheme will work with 256 color terminals but the results might
not be satisfactory. Therefore where available it is recommended to set `termguicolors`.

```VimL
set termguicolors
```
